        A long time ago, I decided that everything I do in life would be in
        service of a purpose. I wasn't sure what that purpose was, and at times
        I found myself desperate to find one. But find one I did. Then I found
        another. Then another. It didn't take long for me to flood myself with
        seemingly important things to do. I have yet to be able to pare that
        back to only one purpose, but I have narrowed things down to four. I
        think they work well together. Below, I share my [current] perspective
        on who I am and why these purposes sum that up.

          Yes, I realize this site is totally self-indulgent. If you aren't here
          to learn more about me though, maybe you came here by accident?
          Regardless, this is a "me" site.
