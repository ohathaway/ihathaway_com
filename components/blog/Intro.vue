        <p>
          I write a lot. Unfortunately, most of what I write is not for
          consumption by ordinary humans. In fact, much of what I write isn't
          intended for humans at all. Because I basically write for a living,
          I do a lot of thinking about the things I write. I also do a lot of
          thinking even when I'm not working. These thoughts I have rarely
          written about in the past.
        </p>

          Here I write about those other things I think about. Things about
          humans... about law (especially US Constitutional issues)...
          IT stuff... but always for humans.

          Since everyone has one, and much of my thinking revolves around the
          concept I've named after it. I call this place, <strong>The Belly
            Button Principal.</strong>
