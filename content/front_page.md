Psychologists Will Tell You That The Best Way To Be Happy Is Not To Pursue Happiness Directly. It Should Be A Side Effect Of Life Lived With Purpose.
  _David Roberts_

A long time ago, I decided that everything I do in life would be in service of a purpose. I wasn't sure what that purpose was, and at times I found myself desperate to find one. But find one I did. Then I found another. Then another. It didn't take long for me to flood myself with seemingly important things to do. I have yet to be able to pare that back to only one purpose, but I have narrowed things down to four. I think they work well together. Below, I share my [current] perspective on who I am and why these purposes sum that up.

### Attorney
Yep. I'm an attorney. Queue your favorite attorney joke here. There are lots of reasons I continue to practice law. You've probably heard many of them already because they aren't so unique. I won't repeat those. I will indulge cliché enough to share that my two fictional attorney heros are Atticus Finch and Perry Mason. Ironic, as I tend not to litigate much. For me, practicing law affords me the opportunity to leverage things I know how to do to help people accomplish things they otherwise wouldn't.

Yes, it's the basic toolset of a transactional attorney. But I enjoy it, and I love living vicariously through my clients' dreams.

Some of those things I know how to do include:
- **Educating small business owners** - When you get that spark of an idea the grows into a passion to build a business, your eyes don't light up discussing entity types, voting procedures, tax models, involuntary exits, and all the other legal mumbo jumbo involved with startups. Your passion centers on the core of your business. Some new business owners have simple goals and simple structures will support them. Others have complicated needs that need careful attention to the design of legal scaffolding they hang the businesss on. I translate the dream into a solid support structure then guide the business owner along the path as the plan encounters real life.
- **Writing tight contracts in English instead of Nerdlish** - Written contracts influence so much of our interaction with other humans (and increasingly with non-humans too). So many of the folks I work with don't know or understand what they've agreed to until there's a problem. I start by eliminating words like, "heretofore", and "wherefore." But that's just the start. Your documents say something about you or your company. Be intentional about that message.
- **Untangling financial rats' nests** - Not every startup assembles the team of professionals it takes to do things right. Most, in fact, just jump right in and start selling. A day of reckoning always comes. Maybe I inherited my CPA grandfather's affinity for double-entry accounting, because my accounting-for-non-accounting-majors education in undergrad has helped me save more than one business from itself. I'm no CPA, but I know what well-kept books look like, and I can translate between numbers and business process. And if the nest is so tangled there just isn't any hope, I can guide the business or its owners through protection in bankruptcy.
- **Preparing for the ultimate exit strategy** - Regardless of whether you plan to sell your business to an investor, try to take it public, or just run it until you're done, we all exit business the same way in the end. Especially with family-owned businesses, end-of-life planning ensures the legacy lives on the way the founders want. Whether that means ensuring a succession for the business or winding it up and distributing the fruits of a life well-lived, Wills, trusts, powers-of-attorney and other documents can make all the difference in ensuring it goes smoothly. Oh, and don't forget life insurance. It's a powerful tool.

### Technologist
Defined by Wiktionary as:
> A person who uses science or technology to solve practical problems.

Early humans used stone tools, such as arrow heads, spear tips, knives, scrapers, and such. These crude implements probably represent the earliest use of technology by our species. By learning to control fire and using language to share knowledge, use of technology may be the core element of what separated humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.
In contrast to the Luddites' approach to technology, I approach problem solving using the best tool I have for the job. I am a walking stereotype when it comes to guys and gadgets, but that fascination affords me the ability to bring a diverse array of tools to many different types of problems.

Tools are cool. Humans are cooler. Put the two together, and we accomplish incredible things.
When it comes to tools, my broadest toolset contains IT-related stuff. A few of the things I can use with some competency:
- Windows management frameworks
- Linux OS
- enterprise networking
- enterprise storage architectures
- cybersecurity
- identity and access management
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- Vue.JS
- Ruby/Rails
- Python
- PHP
- SQL
- NoSQL
- REST APIs
- shell scripting
- HL7
- interface engines
- DevOps
- serverless computing
- PCI-DSS
- NIST 800-53
- CISSP (lapsed)
- HITRUST CSF

### Problem Solver  
The problem with problems is that they're just so problematic. Sure, I know that statement seems more pedantic than necessary. But consider that the vast majority of the problems people and organizations face in life are: 1) created by themselves; 2) simple to solve after eliminating the relevant cognitive biases; or 3) not really a problem at all.

I find that effective problem-solving startes with active listening . More recently trendy folks have talked about this concept as mindful listening . Whatever you want to call it, I aspire to the principles espoused under both labels.

My process then applies what I've learned about thinking from reading folks like Nassim Taleb , Daniel Kahneman , Max Weber (although not in German), Tyler Cowen (unfortunately, I think he's too eclectic to win the economics Nobel Prize he deserves), and Steven Pinker .
After doing some thinking, I reach into my toolbox to see what I have that can help the situation. While my techie tools are the easiest to tick off on a list, I also have lawyer tools, communicator tools, and basic human compassion tools.

### Husband  
I have one and a half life-long projects. I say one and a half because it's definitely more than one, but I can't bring myself to say these two workstreams are two separate things. They're pretty inextricably linked for me. So one and a half. Husband and Dad.

I've been married since 2000 to Michelle. I can't imagine life without her. Strong, nurturing, caring, demanding, fun. We have three daughters. She tells people she's raising four children, three of whom are nominally adults. I'm not sure she's wrong.

As much as I get lost in exploring the contours of whatever I'm working on. She brings me back to pragmatic reality time and time again. Among lots of other things, she's taught me to be cognizant of the fact that those shiny details I love so much only matter to anyone else to the extent I can use them to help someone.

But a marriage doesn't survive on love alone. We work hard to build a life together that brings joy to both of us. I see in companies all the time that great ideas do not conquer the world. Great ideas with great execution do. Same with a marriage. I've never worked as hard at anything else.

And then there's our girls. I could go on for days on them. "Proud papa," says it all and doesn't say enough. Michelle and I promised each other on the day we met that if we ever had kids, we'd screw them up different. We've succeeded so far.
