title: Compliance Program
description: >
  Innovative payment models in healthcare inevitably come with strings attached.
  Complying with those strictures can become a barrier to achieving the goals
  the program sets out to accomplish. Effective yet unobtrusive compliance
  monitoring and certification by a third-party can satisfy the requirements
  while leaving the program room to innovate.
