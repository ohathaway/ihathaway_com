          Yep. I'm an attorney. <i>Queue your favorite attorney joke here.</i>
          There are lots of reasons I continue to practice law. You've probably
          heard many of them already because they aren't so unique. I won't
          repeat those. I will indulge clich&eacute; enough to share that my two
          fictional attorney heros are Atticus Finch and Perry Mason. Ironic, as
          I tend not to litigate much. For me, practicing law affords me the
          opportunity to leverage things I know how to do to help people
          accomplish things they otherwise wouldn't.
        </p>

          Yes, it's the basic toolset of a transactional attorney. But I enjoy
          it, and I love living vicariously through my clients' dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of those things I know how to do include:

              Educating small business owners
            </span>
            - When you get that spark of an idea that grows into a passion to
            build a business, your eyes don't light up discussing entity types,
            voting procedures, tax models, involuntary exits, and all the other
            legal mumbo jumbo involved with startups. Your passion centers on
            the core of your business. Some new business owners have simple
            goals and simple structures will support them. Others have
            complicated needs that need careful attention to the design of legal
            scaffolding they hang the businesss on. I translate the dream into a
            solid support structure then guide the business owner along the path
            as the plan encounters real life.

              Writing tight contracts in English instead of Nerdlish
            </span>
            - Written contracts influence so much of our interaction with other
            humans (and increasingly with non-humans too). So many of the folks
            I work with don't know or understand what they've agreed to until
            there's a problem. I start by eliminating words like, "heretofore",
            and "wherefore." But that's just the start. Your documents say
            something about you or your company. Be intentional about that
            message.

              Untangling financial rats' nests
            </span>
            - Not every startup assembles the team of professionals it takes to
            do things right. Most, in fact, just jump right in and start
            selling. A day of reckoning always comes. Maybe I inherited my CPA
            grandfather's affinity for double-entry accounting, because my
            accounting-for-non-accounting-majors education in undergrad has
            helped me save more than one business from itself. I'm no CPA, but I
            know what well-kept books look like, and I can translate between
            numbers and business processes. And if the nest is so tangled there
            just isn't any hope, I can guide the business or its owners through
            protection in bankruptcy.

              Preparing for the ultimate exit strategy
            </span>
            - Regardless of whether you plan to sell your business to an
            investor, try to take it public, or just run it until you're done,
            we all exit business the same way in the end. Especially with
            family-owned businesses, end-of-life planning ensures the legacy
            lives on the way the founders want. Whether that means ensuring a
            succession for the business or winding it up and distributing the
            fruits of a life well-lived, wills, trusts, powers-of-attorney and
            other documents can make all the difference in ensuring it goes
            smoothly. Oh, and don't forget life insurance. It's a powerful tool.
