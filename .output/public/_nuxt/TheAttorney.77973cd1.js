I&#39;m an attorney. <i>Queue your favorite attorney joke here.</i> There are lots of reasons I continue to practice law. You&#39;ve probably heard many of them already because they aren&#39;t so unique. I won&#39;t repeat those. I will indulge clich\xE9 enough to share that my two fictional attorney heros are Atticus Finch and Perry Mason. Ironic as I tend not to litigate much. For me, practicing law affords me the opportunity to leverage things I know how to do to help people accomplish things they otherwise wouldn&#39;t. </p><p> Yes, it&#39;s the basic toolset of a transactional attorney. But I enjoy it, and I love living vicariously through my clients&#39; dreams. </p><p> Some of those things I know how to do include: <ul><li class="mb-2"><span class="text-decoration-underline">Educating small business owners</span> - When you get that spark of an idea the grows into a passion to build a business, your eyes don&#39;t light up discussing entity types, voting procedures, tax models, involuntary exits, and all the other legal mumbo jumbo involved with startups. Your passion centers on the core of your business. Some new business owners have simple goals and simple structures will support them. Others have complicated needs that need careful attention to the design of legal scaffolding they hang the businesss on. I translate the dream into a solid support structure then guide the business owner along the path as the plan encounters real life. </li><li class="mb-2"><span class="text-decoration-underline">Writing tight contracts in English instead of Nerdlish</span> - Written contracts influence so much of our interaction with other humans (and increasingly with non-humans too). So many of the folks I work with don&#39;t know or understand what they&#39;ve agreed to until there&#39;s a problem. I start by eliminating words like, &quot;heretofore&quot;, and &quot;wherefore.&quot; But that&#39;s just the start. Your documents say something about you or your company. Be intentional about that message. </li><li class="mb-2"><span class="text-decoration-underline">Untangling financial rats&#39; nests</span> - Not every startup assembles the team of professionals it takes to do things right. Most, in fact, just jump right in and start selling. A day of reckoning always comes. Maybe I inherited my CPA grandfather&#39;s affinity for double-entry accounting, because my accounting-for-non-accounting-majors education in undergrad has helped me save more than one business from itself. I&#39;m no CPA, but I know what well-kept books look like, and I can translate between numbers and business process. And if the nest is so tangled there just isn&#39;t any hope, I can guide the business or its owners through protection in bankruptcy. </li><li><span class="text-decoration-underline">Preparing for the ultimate exit strategy</span> - Regardless of whether you plan to sell your business to an investor, try to take it public, or just run it until you&#39;re done, we all exit business the same way in the end. Especially with family-owned businesses, end-of-life planning ensures the legacy lives on the way the founders want. Whether that means ensuring a succession for the business or winding it up and distributing the fruits of a life well-lived, Wills, trusts, powers-of-attorney and other documents can make all the difference in ensuring it goes smoothly. Oh, and don&#39;t forget life insurance. It&#39;s a powerful tool. </li></ul></p></div>',1);function g(m,y){const t=s("font-awesome-icon");return a(),i("section",u,[e("div",d,[e("header",h,[e("h1",null,[o(t,{icon:"fa-solid fa-scale-balanced",class:"d-lg-none pe-3"}),r(" Attorney\xA0\xA0\xA0 ")])]),e("div",p,[e("h1",null,[o(t,{icon:"fa-solid fa-scale-balanced"})])]),f])])}const _=n(c,[["render",g]]);export{_ as default};
