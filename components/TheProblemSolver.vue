          The problem with problems is that they're just so problematic. Sure, I
          know that statement seems more pedantic than necessary. But consider
          that the vast majority of the problems people and organizations face
          in life are: 1) created by themselves; 2) simple to solve after
          eliminating the relevant cognitive biases; or 3) not really a problem
          at all.

          I find that effective problem-solving startes with

            title="Active Listening"

            title="Mindful Listening"

          under both labels.

          My process then applies what I've learned about thinking from reading
          folks like

          After doing some thinking, I reach into my toolbox to see what I have
          that can help the situation. While my techie tools are the easiest to
          tick off on a list, I also have lawyer tools, communicator tools, and
          basic human compassion tools.
