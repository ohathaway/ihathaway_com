          I have one and a half life-long projects. I say one and a half because
          it's definitely more than one, but I can't bring myself to say these
          two workstreams are two separate things. They're pretty inextricably
          linked for me. So one and a half. Husband and Dad.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been married since 2000 to Michelle. I can't imagine life without
          her. Strong, nurturing, caring, demanding, fun. We have three
          daughters. She tells people she's raising four children, all of whom
          are nominally adults. I'm not sure she's wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
          As much as I get lost in exploring the contours of whatever I'm
          working on. She brings me back to pragmatic reality time and time
          again. Among lots of other things, she's taught me to be cognizant of
          the fact that those shiny details I love so much only matter to anyone
          else to the extent I can use them to help someone.
        </p>
        <p>
          But a marriage doesn't survive on love alone. We work hard to build a
          life together that brings joy to both of us. I see in companies all
          the time that great ideas do not conquer the world. Great ideas with
          great execution do. Same with a marriage. I've never worked as hard at
          anything else.
        </p>
        <p>
          And then there's our girls. I could go on for days on them. "Proud
          papa," says it all and doesn't say enough. Michelle and I promised
          each other on the day we met that if we ever had kids, we'd screw them
          up different. I think we've succeeded so far.
